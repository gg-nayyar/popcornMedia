## Getting Started

Each service contains its own README and setup instructions. To run the full stack locally:

1. Install dependencies for each backend service and the frontend.
2. Start each backend service (`auth`, `location_service`, `selection_service`) using their respective `dev` scripts.
3. Start the API gateway.
4. Start the frontend with `npm run dev` in the `frontend` directory.

## Future Scope

PopcornMedia is being developed into a comprehensive Movie Ticket Booking platform. Planned features include:

- **User Registration & Authentication:** Secure sign-up, login, and profile management.
- **Location-Based Selection:** Users can select their city/state to view relevant theatres and movies.
- **Movie & Theatre Listings:** Browse movies, categories, theatres, and showtimes filtered by location.
- **Seat Selection & Booking:** Interactive seat maps and real-time booking.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment gateway for ticket purchases.
- **Booking History:** Users can view and manage their past and upcoming bookings.
- **Admin Panel:** Manage movies, theatres, showtimes, and user accounts.
- **Notifications:** Email/SMS notifications for booking confirmations and reminders.
- **Reviews & Ratings:** Users can rate movies and theatres.
- **Scalability:** Microservices architecture for easy scaling and maintenance.
